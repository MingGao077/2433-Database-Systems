## Project Part 1 to Part 3
These folder contains the contents we submitted to Brightspace according to the requirements of the project.

## Part 4
We finalized the end-to-end web application in the part of project.

- Backend.ipynb: This notebook is used for the backend process, which contains collecting new data, connecting databases and frontend, machine learning (prediction), reply result to the frontend.
- Backend-test.ipynb: This notebook is a test file for the backend development.
- Web App.html: This is our frontend html file, we generate customers' data and show the prediction result on this interface. Two command: Predict/Add. Predict: Base on existed training set, we give a result wheather the customer is interested. Add: Adding this customer's information into training set for the future prediction.
- database.sql: This is the MySQL database we set locally, it stores all the training data and test data for the machine learning processes. 

## How to Use The Web Application
If you want to test the web application, you should first download the database.sql and deploy locally. Then, you want to run the Backend.ipynb, and do not forget to modify the database's path. Finally, you can open the web page to try the web application.
